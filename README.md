This is a personal website created by HTML and CSS.
It is important not to use inline styling for this assignment.
I learned to set up a panel on the right for the photo on my home page and the content on the left.
I learned that it is easier to set the position relative so that when I change the window size, the page still shows up alright.
I spent half of the snow day working on the assignment.
